# Replication Material for "Transmission Channel Analysis in Dynamic Models"

> [!NOTE]
> The paper "Transmission Channel Analysis in Dynamic Models" can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18987). The different versions on arXiv are tracked by the different releases here on GitHub. Releases are located in the right side-bar on deskop computers and laptops and on the bottom of the page on mobile devices. 

The replication material is split into three parts. 

1. The folder 'section-5-1' contains all replication material for Section 5.1 "Forward Guidance of Monetary Policy". Replication requires the Julia language. 
2. The folder 'section-5-2' contains all replication material for Section 5.2 "Anticipation Effects of Government Spending". Replication requires the Julia language. 
3. The folder 'section-5-3' contains all replication material for Section 5.3 "The Role of Inflation Expecations in DSGEs". Replication requires Matlab. Plots can also be created using Julia. 

All folders contain 'README.md' files explaining how to replicate the results. 

## Related Code 
Some of the replication relies on the Julia package "TransmissionChannelAnalysis.jl" which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/enweg/TransmissionChannelAnalysis.jl).
