# Replication Material for "Transmission Channel Analysis in Dynamic Models"

The replication material is split into three parts. 

1. The folder 'section-5-1' contains all replication material for Section 5.1
   "Forward Guidance of Monetary Policy". Replication requires the Julia language. 
2. The folder 'section-5-2' contains all replication material for Section 5.2
   "Anticipation Effects of Government Spending". Replication requires the Julia language. 
3. The folder 'section-5-3' contains all replication material for Section 5.3
   "The Role of Inflation Expecations in DSGEs". Replication requires Matlab. 

All folders contain 'README.md' files explaining how to replicate the results. 

## Related Code 
Some of the replication relies on the Julia package "TransmissionChannelAnalysis.jl" which can be found
on [GitHub](https://github.com/enweg/TransmissionChannelAnalysis.jl).
